# Race S.O.P

This is my checklist for Over the Hump. Will require adjustment for other races.

## Week Prior to Race

* Shake-out ride to verify all fixes/adjustments
* Double-check fuel & supplies, order more if needed

## Day Before
* "Openers" workout to prep the legs. (A few short, punchy climbs & ~10 min of climbing at 165+ BPM)
